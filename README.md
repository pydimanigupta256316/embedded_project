# Theory
We usually observed the heat control system in a car.But in this project we control the temperature of a seat.When a user or driver seated on a car,the button sensor activated and if the user wants to activate heater he turn on the heater by turn on the switch .When both switches are activated then the user can adjust the temperature and send the analog value to microcontroller.The microcontroller converts the input from the temperature sensor and shows the temperature value throgh serial communication.All the activities of this system are done with help of Atmega328 microcontroller.

# simulation

The functionality of this project is coded with embedded c and the simulation is done through Simulide.Below two images shows the On & Off conditions of the system
